*Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is specifically designed to handle sequential data, such as time series, speech, and text. 

*LSTM networks are capable of learning long-term dependencies in sequential data, which makes them well suited for tasks such as language translation, speech recognition, and time series forecasting.
